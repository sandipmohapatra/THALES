Eclipse Debug:-

Bug:- It is a problem in application. Might be error/exception, wrong output, 
      warnings..etc.

--Bug Code--
 void withDrawMoney(int accNum,double amtWtd){
	double bal=getBal(accNum);
	bal = bal + amtWtd; //bug code
 }
-----------
Debug: It is a process of Identify bug in application.

*)Debug is not used to fix bug. It is used to identify bug.
  After identity it must be fixed by programmer/Dev..etc

Q)How can we do Debug?
A)We should indetify module where it is not working properly.
  Like User module, Admin Module, Payment Module..etc
  After Identifying module we should check code 
  block by block or line by line.

  IDE-STS/Eclipse Debug Tool (Shortcuts)


*)Breakpoint: To debug app, we should create atleast one breakpoint
            Entry/Start point, Pause Point, next block points.

*)Remove Breakpoints  : To remove all breakpoints at a time use this option (xx Symbol)

*) Disable Breakpoints : While executing app Bug is found or no need of executing
        other breakspoints then skip execution of other breakpoints by 
	disable them (ctrl+alt+B)
